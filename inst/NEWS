# Release Branch News

Note that the news items for this branch are fairly limited. This is by design, because this branch represents a "stable release" on Bioconductor, which means only critical bug fixes are made to the 1.0.z "stable" version after its release. Much more development has been done on the 1.1.z "development branch", which is released live and incremental on GitHub and more staggered at the devel link on Bioconductor. Please see the official Installation Instructions on the GitHub site for details on obtaining and installing your flavor of choice:
